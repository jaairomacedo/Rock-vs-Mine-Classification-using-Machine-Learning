# Rock vs Mine Classification using Machine Learning
 
## About

This project was undertaken during the 'Special Topics in Quantitative Methods' course at Pimes/UFPE. The dataset utilized in this project aligns with that employed by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study on the classification of sonar signals using a neural network, titled 'Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets.'"

Feel free to let me know if you have any more requests or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
